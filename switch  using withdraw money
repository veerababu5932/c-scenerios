The program displays an ATM menu with four options.

The user enters a choice (1-4).

The program uses a switch statement to:

Check Balance (Display current balance).

Withdraw Money (If enough balance, deduct and update).

Deposit Money (Add to balance).

Exit (End the program).

If the user selects an invalid option, an error message is displayed.

The while(1) loop keeps the program running until the user chooses to Exit (4)
