Step-by-Step Example
Imagine the user types "cat". The string str1 is stored as ['c', 'a', 't', '\0']. Let’s walk through the loop:

Start: length = 0
Check: str1[0] is 'c'. Is 'c' not \0? Yes, so keep going.
Do: length++ → length = 1.
Next Round: length = 1
Check: str1[1] is 'a'. Is 'a' not \0? Yes, so keep going.
Do: length++ → length = 2.
Next Round: length = 2
Check: str1[2] is 't'. Is 't' not \0? Yes, so keep going.
Do: length++ → length = 3.
Next Round: length = 3
Check: str1[3] is \0. Is \0 not \0? No, it’s equal to \0.
Stop: The loop ends because the condition is false.
Result: length is now 3, which is the number of characters in "cat".
Real-Life Analogy
Imagine you’re counting how many people are in a line, but you don’t know the total yet. You start at the first person and say:

"Are you the last person?" (No, there’s someone behind them.)
Move to the next person and ask again.
Keep going until you reach someone who says, "Yes, I’m the last one!" Then you stop and count how many people you passed.
In the program:

Each character is a "person."
\0 is the "last one" that tells you the line (string) is over.
length is your tally of how many you’ve counted.
Key Points for Students
Repeating: The while loop repeats as long as the condition is true (str1[length] != '\0').
Counting: Each time it loops, it adds 1 to length, building the total count.
Stopping: It stops when it hits \0, the end of the string.
Order Matters: We check the condition before running the body. If str1[0] were \0 (an empty string), the loop wouldn’t run at all!
\\Scenario Explanation:
\\\\\\\\\\\\Imagine you visit a library and pick up a book. However, this book does not have page numbers or a table of contents. You want to find out how many pages it has, so you decide to count them one by one.

Step-by-Step Process (Like strlen()):
Start at the First Page – You open the book and begin counting from the first page.

Keep Counting – You turn each page and increase your count by one.

Find the End – Eventually, you reach the back cover, which tells you that the book has ended.

Final Count – The total number of pages you counted gives you the length of the book.

How This Relates to strlen():
Each page in the book represents a character in a string.

The back cover of the book is like the null terminator (\0) in a string, marking the end.

You don’t count the back cover itself, just like strlen() does not count the \0 at the end of a string.
