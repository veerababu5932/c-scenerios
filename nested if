Scenario: ATM PIN Verification (Using Nested if)
Explanation:
The user must enter a correct 4-digit PIN to access their account.

If the PIN is correct, they can withdraw money (if they have enough balance).

If the PIN is incorrect, access is denied.

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int pin, amount, balance = 5000; // Initial balance is 5000

    // Asking user to enter PIN
    printf("Enter your 4-digit ATM PIN: ");
    scanf("%d", &pin);

    if (pin == 1234) {  // Checking correct PIN
        printf("PIN Correct! Enter amount to withdraw: ");
        scanf("%d", &amount);

        if (amount > 0 && amount <= balance) {  // Checking sufficient balance
            balance -= amount; // Deduct amount from balance
            printf("Withdrawal successful! Remaining balance: %d\n", balance);
        } else {
            printf("Insufficient balance or invalid amount!\n");
        }
    } else {
        printf("Incorrect PIN! Access Denied.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
